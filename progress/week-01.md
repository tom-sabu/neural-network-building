## ðŸ’» C++ Learning Progress (New Focus!)

### What Happened This Week:
**Day 1**: Watched math video, attempted to code â†’ stuck on C++ syntax  
**Day 2**: Realized C++ knowledge gap (classes, const, references)  
**Day 3**: Started learncpp.com - learning forward declarations, functions

### C++ Concepts Learned:
- [x] Forward declarations
- [x] Why functions must be declared before main
- [ ] Classes and objects (in progress)
- [ ] const keyword
- [ ] References vs pointers
- [ ] Header files

**Resources Using**:
- learncpp.com (Chapter 1-12 review, Chapter 13+ focus)

## ðŸŽ‰ Week Summary

**ðŸ“Š Stats:**
- **Total time invested**: 7 hours
- **Videos completed**: 1/3 (theory only)
- **Code written**: Attempted, identified learning needs
- **Days studied**: 3/7
- **Major decision**: Revised learning path âœ…

**ðŸŽ¯ Key Achievement:**
**Honest self-assessment** - Recognized C++ gap early rather than struggling for weeks!

**ðŸ§  What I Learned:**
- Vectors are lists of numbers that can be added and scaled
- Three perspectives: physicist, CS, mathematician
- **CRITICAL**: Need C++ fundamentals before implementing math concepts
- Forward declarations in C++
- Function declaration rules

**ðŸ’ª Confidence Level:** 7/10 (on revised path)

**ðŸ“ˆ Understanding Level:** 
- Math concepts: 8/10 (theory)
- C++ implementation: 4/10 (improving!)

## ðŸ”„ Next Week Plan (Week 2)

### New Focus: C++ Fundamentals

**Goals:**
- [ ] Complete learncpp.com Chapter 13 (Classes)
- [ ] Understand const and references
- [ ] Learn header file structure
- [ ] Practice with simple class exercises (Point2D, Circle, Rectangle)
- [ ] Continue watching 3Blue1Brown (theory only, Videos 2-4)

**Daily Plan:**
- **Morning (1-1.5h)**: C++ learning from learncpp.com
- **Evening (30-45min)**: 3Blue1Brown videos (conceptual understanding)

**Why This Works:**
By Week 3, I'll have both C++ skills AND math understanding, ready to implement!

## ðŸ’­ Reflections

**What Went Well:**
- Identified the real problem quickly (C++ knowledge)
- Didn't give up or feel bad about it
- Made intelligent course correction
- Kept honest tracking

**What to Improve:**
- Should have assessed C++ skills before starting
- Need consistent daily practice

**Motivation:**
Still excited! The path is clearer now. Two weeks of C++ focus will make everything easier.

**Quote from Day 3**: "I found out I'm a whole beginner in C++ coding, so I started reading... Then I found concepts in C++ that are new to me."

**This is perfect learning!** Recognizing gaps and filling them systematically.
