## 29-09-2025 - Day 1: Starting the Journey!

**⏰ Time Invested**: 2.5 hours  
**📚 Main Activity**: Watched 3Blue1Brown Video 1, implemented vector operations  
**💻 Code Written**: Vector2D class with add() and scale() methods  

**🧠 Key Insight**: 
*Today i learned what vectors are, and how they can be added and  multiplied. From the video by 3Blue1Brown I learned that there are three perspective to look at vectors , as a physicist, as a computer scientist, and as a mathematician. And as a guy who trying to develop neural network i understand that i  must look at vectors as a computer scientist (at least for now). 
This is the first lecture i ever had into the journey towards learning neural network.*

**🎯 Tomorrow's Goal**: 
Watch Video 2 about linear combinations and span

## 30-09-2025 - Day 2

**⏰ Time Invested**: 1.5 hours  
**📚 Main Activity**:   On day two I didn't actually learned anything I was just solving some problems I made the day before, Not particularly a problems but some change's in arrangements of the file structure, updated and included some files. Also I did try to write program for the first video (not finished), implementing addition and multiplication of vectors. What I learned while coding was that (using AI 😅), there are so many concepts there in c++ that I need to learn, I generate the code using AI and tried to understand it but can't and that's the end of my day, I was busy later. 
**💻 Code Written**:   As I mentioned above I tried to write, but not able to.

**🧠 Key Insight**:  *I understand that i need to learn c++ some more, all that i know now is some basic things  about c. Didn't got the time to watch the second video.*

**❓ Questions/Stuck On**: Got stuck while coding.

**🎯 Tomorrow's Goal**:  Want to understand the concepts behind the code i generated with the AI

## 01-10-2025 - Day 3

**⏰ Time Invested**: 3 hours  
	**📚 Main Activity**:   Learning c++, yesterday i found out that i am whole beginner in c++ coding, so I started reading an article called "LEARN C++" on https://www.learncpp.com/, today again i tried to understand the first videos code, guess what, I still didn't understand a thing, that's why i started reading hehe.
	I didn't directly jump into the part where i try to understand, I clicked some topics that i found i need a recall and there i found concepts in c++ that is new to me. Then i end my day there (no further progress in video series)
**💻 Code Written**:   No code written today.

**🧠 Key Insight**: *While reading the article i found out some concepts that i didn't know before, which is, when we declare a function always declare it before the main because otherwise the compiler wouldn't be able to find that function, result's in runtime error. But there is a counter mentioned in the article they called it "forward declaration". A **forward declaration** allows us to tell the compiler about the existence of an identifier _before_ actually defining the identifier.
That's all for today.*

**🎯 Tomorrow's Goal**: Just like today, want to understand the code, and second watch the next video on the series.
