## Key Concepts

### What is a Preprocessor?
- What i understood from reading is that preprocessors does its part when we run the code, though they mention some other features what a preprocessor does, the main thing they said is that it is preprocessor that handles the "#include" directives of the code, when we include some other outer libraries or the ones created by us, what it does is that it copy the contents inside that library and replace it with the "#include" directive (while we run the program, only after this process the compilation actually starts).

#### Insight I got from this concept
- Also, reading this concept was a major break-through for my learning journey, yesterday, as i mentioned i was trying to figuring out the program i written for the first video of the series "linear algebra essentials", but there i got stuck cause of the lack of knowledge in c++, but this article about preprocessor revealed one of the obstacle that i have been stuck on, yesterday i didn't know how "#include" directives works and how they manage the different files of the program, it was all pixelated yesterday but now it is more clear now.
