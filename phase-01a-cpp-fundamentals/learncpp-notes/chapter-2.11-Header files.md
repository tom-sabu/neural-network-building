## Key Concepts

### What are Header files?
-  Header files are created for containing forward declaration that's what i understood from reading, as our program grows large it would be hard and not very good looking to write forward declaration on top of a single file which containing the code, so we create a separate header file which contains all the forward declarations, reducing complexity. 

### Insight I got from this concept
- just like i mentioned there in "chapter-2.10-introduction to preprocessor" this was also a concept that revealed an obstacle i was dealing with understanding the code i wrote for the video lecture about vectors by 3Blue1Brown. It is more clear now how the code works.
