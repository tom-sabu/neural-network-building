## 🎯 Current Status
**Phase 1A: C++ Fundamentals** | Week 1/30 (adjusted timeline)  
Currently learning: C++ classes and objects from learncpp.com

### This Week's Focus
- [x] Identify C++ knowledge gaps (Day 1-3)
- [ ] Complete learncpp.com Chapter 13: Introduction to Classes
- [ ] Understand const correctness and references
- [ ] Practice with simple class exercises
- [ ] Watch 3Blue1Brown Video 2 (theory only, no coding yet)

## 📚 Currently Using Resources
**C++ Learning**:
- [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) - Primary C++ tutorial (Chapter 13+)
- Focus: Classes, objects, const, references, headers

**Math (Theory Only for Now)**:
- [3Blue1Brown - Essence of Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
- Watched: 1/15 videos (understanding vectors conceptually)

---

## 💻 Hardware
**GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop (6GB VRAM)
- CUDA Cores: 3,840
- Tensor Cores: Yes (perfect for neural networks!)
- Compute Capability: 8.6 (Ampere architecture)

---

## 📊 Current Week Stats
- **Days studied**: 3/7
- **C++ concepts learned**: Forward declaration, function basics
- **Videos watched**: 1/15 (theory understood)
- **Code attempts**: Vector2D (identified knowledge gaps - good!)
- **Honest realization**: Need C++ fundamentals before math implementation ✅

---

## 🔄 Learning Path Adjustment
### Original Plan:
Week 1-3: Linear Algebra + Implementation → **Hit C++ knowledge gap** ❌

### Revised Plan (Current):
**Week 1-2**: C++ Fundamentals (classes, objects, const, references)  
**Week 3-5**: Linear Algebra + Implementation (with C++ confidence) ✅  
**Week 6+**: Continue as planned

**Why this works**: Building solid C++ foundation prevents frustration later!

### Technology Switch:
**Original**: Vulkan compute shaders  
**Updated**: CUDA programming  
**Reason**: CUDA is purpose-built for neural networks, has better ecosystem (cuDNN, cuBLAS), and is more efficient for ML workloads. Perfect match for RTX 3060's Tensor Cores!

---

## 💡 Key Learning Insight
**From Day 3**: "I found out I'm a whole beginner in C++ coding"  
**Response**: Perfect self-awareness! Taking 2 weeks to learn C++ properly will save months of frustration.

**Strategy**: 
- Morning: Learn C++ from learncpp.com
- Evening: Watch 3Blue1Brown (theory/concepts only)
- Week 3+: Implement math concepts with confidence
